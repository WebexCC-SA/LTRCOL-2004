Instead, the compliance officer must generate a report for all activity for a particular user or set of users or for all activity within one or more messaging spaces.  Let's generate an eDiscovery report for one of our users: Kellie Melby.

We'll use this template to add a user (custodian) to a Legal Hold/Legal matter.</p> <p>Open the downloaded CSV template in Excel and add Kellie Melby's email address kmelby@cbXXX.dc-YY.com to the second row (values for 'XXX' and 'YY' are on your pod sheet).</p> <p>Click the save icon to save your change to the template file.</p> <p>Click Yes to maintain the custodian file in CSV format.</p> <p></p> <p>Return to the Create Matter dialog and click Browse. Locate the CustodianImportTemplate.csv file you just edited and select. Click Open.</p> <p>Click Save to finish creating the legal matter. Keep an eye on the 'Create Matter' process and ensure that the legal matter setup completes. Click Close to acknowledge once the matter is created.</p> <p></p> <p>Returning to the Legal matters page, you will see that there is now an active legal matter. Click the matter name to load the legal matter details. Notice there are options to add/remove user/custodians as well as to 'Release' (or close) a matter.</p> <p></p> <p>At this point there is nothing left to do for this legal matter. Note that all users/custodians associated to a legal matter / Legal Hold will have all their available data retained beyond the configured retention period.</p> <p>In this case, this means that all of Kellie Melby's user generated data will be retained indefinitely, overriding the current Webex Control Hub configured retention period of 360 days which we reviewed earlier. If/when the Legal Hold is released for this matter / custodian, the 360-day period for data retention would apply.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Theta Lake also supports near real-time DLP for files and messages with automatic remediation.</p>"},{"location":"conclusion/","title":"Conclusion","text":""},{"location":"conclusion/#related-sessions-at-cisco-live","title":"Related Sessions at Cisco Live","text":"<ul> <li>BRKXXX-1111 My friend's breakout session</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/","title":"Introduction","text":""},{"location":"introduction/#securing-webex-with-identity-management-zero-trust-encryption-and-data-compliance","title":"Securing Webex with Identity Management, Zero Trust Encryption, and Data Compliance","text":"<p>This lab explores Webex security and educates attendees on the practical steps required to enable and manage security features and functions available with Webex deployments, including:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Identity, Authentication (AuthN), and Authorization (AuthZ): Enable   user provisioning and directory synchronization, explore settings and   licensing templates, enable multi-factor authentication, and configure   single sign-on (SSO) using SAML and OpenID Connect.</p> </li> <li> <p>End-to-End (E2E) Encryption: Examine Webex zero trust end-to-end encrypted meetings and calling, along with media watermarking, and deepfake integration with Webex.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compliance: Investigate compliance for Webex meetings and calling including eDiscovery with Theta Lake.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Table of Contents</p> <ul> <li>About This Lab</li> <li>Requirements</li> <li>Lab Details</li> <li>Topology</li> <li>Getting Started</li> <li>Module 1: Webex Identity and Authentication/Authorization with Duo<ul> <li>Sync Users from Active Directory to Duo</li> <li>Sync Users from Duo to Webex</li> <li>Webex Licensing and Settings Templates</li> <li>Configuring Duo to Use Active Directory for User Authentication</li> <li>Single Sign-On with Webex and Duo (SAML and OIDC)<ul> <li>Duo SSO Setup (SAML)</li> <li>Duo SSO Setup (OIDC)</li> </ul> </li> <li>OpenID Connect -- Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)</li> <li>Multiple Identity Providers with Webex</li> <li>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using Duo</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Module 2: Zero Trust End-to-End Encrypted Calling and Meetings, Media Watermarking, and Deepfake Detection</p> <ul> <li>Schedule an End-to-End Encrypted Meeting</li> <li>Features in an End-to-End Encrypted Meeting</li> <li>Audio and Visual Watermarking and Watermark Analysis</li> <li>Deepfake Detection with GetReal Labs and Webex</li> <li>Provision Users and Configure Zero Trust End-to-End Encrypted Calling</li> <li>Zero Trust End-to-End Encrypted Calling</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Module 3: Webex Compliance with Webex and Theta Lake</p> <ul> <li>Webex Compliance and Preparing for Compliance Platform Integration</li> <li>Explore eDiscovery for Webex Meetings in Theta Lake</li> <li>Explore eDiscovery for Webex Calling in Theta Lake</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Appendix</p> <ul> <li>Explore Webex eDiscovery Search and Extraction Portal</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/#lab-sections-quick-links","title":"Lab Sections Quick Links","text":"<ul> <li>About This Lab \u2192 About This Lab</li> <li>Topology \u2192 Lab Topology </li> <li>Getting Started \u2192 Getting Started</li> <li>Module 1 \u2192 Webex Identity and Authentication/Authorization with Duo</li> <li>Module 2 \u2192 Zero Trust End-to-End Encrypted Calling and Meetings, Media Watermarking, and Deepfake Detection</li> <li>Module 3 \u2192 Webex Compliance with Webex and Theta Lake</li> <li>Appendix \u2192 Explore Webex eDiscovery Search and Extraction Portal</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/#about-this-lab","title":"About This Lab","text":"<p>Webex provides customers with a comprehensive set of security and compliance capabilities across the Webex suite.

Automated license and settings template assignment can be done on a group no matter how it was created (synchronized, locally created in Control Hub, or created via the Groups API or the SCIM 2.0 Groups API endpoint). This automation can be configured before syncing users into Webex, but the more common scenario is an organization where the users are already synced, and the licensing or settings configuration needs to be modified -- that's what you will do in this section.</p> <p>Webex uses a combination of Organization-based licensing and Group-based licensing:</p> <p>Organization-based licensing \u2192 All users that are synchronized    into the organization will be granted these licenses. Typically, this    is used to grant all users access to basic features like basic    messaging and meetings.</p> <p>Group-based licensing \u2192 Each group can be assigned specific    licenses and users who are members of those groups will receive those    licenses automatically. Users can be members of multiple groups so    each premium feature can be tied to a different group for granular    control over license distribution.</p> <p>When these two features are combined with disabling license preservation, the following will occur:</p> <ul> <li> <p>All users synced to the org will have access to basic features.</p> </li> <li> <p>As users are added to specific groups, they can be assigned licenses   for premium features.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the user is subsequently removed from a group, any license granted   by being a member of that group will be removed.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This is an effective way to automate license management while ensuring that oversubscription does not occur. While this is very powerful, this is not a universal solution. In some scenarios, a subset of users in a specific directory group(s) will need different licenses than other users in those group(s). In these scenarios, license management can be handled by using local Webex groups either manually via Control Hub or programmatically via API.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Click Users &gt; Licenses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click Set up under the Organization-based licenses section.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>In the Messaging section, you should find that Basic Messaging is already assigned.

The most common OAuth flows are listed below, in order of least secure to most secure:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Implicit Flow (deprecated in OAuth 2.1 -- included here for awareness)</p> </li> <li> <p>Device Authorization Flow</p> </li> <li> <p>Authorization Code Flow</p> </li> <li> <p>Authorization Code Flow with PKCE</p> </li> </ol> <p>By default, the Webex application uses Authorization Code Flow when authenticating users. In this model, the user never directly sees access or refresh tokens. Instead, the Identity Provider (IdP) issues a short-lived authorization code, which the Webex application forwards to the Webex cloud. Webex then exchanges that code for access, refresh, and ID tokens over a secure backchannel using its client credentials. This ensures that tokens are never exposed in the browser or during redirects, reducing the risk of interception.</p> <p>Authorization Code Flow with PKCE is an enhancement designed for public clients like the Webex desktop and mobile apps, which cannot safely store a client secret. Instead of a static secret, the app generates a one-time code verifier and sends a hashed version of it (the code challenge) during the initial request. When redeeming the authorization code, the app must present the original verifier. If an attacker were to intercept the authorization code, they would not be able to exchange it for tokens without also having the verifier.</p> <p>This is why PKCE is recommended for any deployment where the client is not a secure backend server that can be trusted to store sensitive secrets --- such as the Webex application. Refer to the diagram below for a visualization of the login process when PKCE is enabled.</p> <p></p> <p>For more technical information, refer to the RFC for Auth Code Flow w/ PKCE: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636</p>"},{"location":"module1_identity/#multiple-identity-providers-with-webex","title":"Multiple Identity Providers with Webex","text":"<p>Multiple IdPs is a powerful tool that allows administrators to route users to a different IdP depending on either their group or their domain. This feature also allows you to use Webex Common Identity (CI) as an IdP which means users will use local Webex authentication rather than being routed to a third-party IdP. Some common use-cases for this feature include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Mergers and acquisitions</p> </li> <li> <p>Education or government institutions</p> </li> <li> <p>Partners using Webex as a consumer service</p> </li> <li> <p>Global enterprises with separate IT organizations</p> </li> </ul> <p>While powerful, this feature should only be used as a last resort. A rogue administrator could configure Webex to route users to an IdP that may not be monitored by an organization's security admins. If this IdP looked identical to the one with which users were accustomed to authenticating, users may not be aware that they are giving their credentials to a bad actor. In a different scenario, an IdP could be configured with a less strict password policy than is required by the security team.</p> <p>Due to the inherent risk of a feature like this, new alerts have been created to notify administrators when key changes are made. These alerts can be found at Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Audit &gt; Admin activities:</p> <ul> <li>When IdP is added to Webex, an alert is generated.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>When an IdP is deleted, an alert is generated.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>When a routing rule is created, an alert is generated.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>When the routing rule order is modified, an alert is generated.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>These alerts provide notice if an administrator makes changes to the SSO configuration. In addition, you can also enable logging of authentication events by navigating to Security &gt; Audit &gt; Authentication Activities &gt; Generate Access and enable Allow user authentication data. Refer to the screenshot below for sample data with this toggle enabled.</p> <p></p> <p>If there is an issue with SSO at any point, a full administrator can use https://admin.webex.com/manage-sso to disable SSO or update the IdP metadata.</p> <p>At this point in the lab, you have already configured two IdPs, Duo (SAML) and Duo (OIDC). Since you configured the SAML integration first, it is configured as your default IdP. This means that any users not matching the GroupRule routing rule you created will be sent to your SAML integration. Note that in this lab, we're using the same Duo tenant for both IdPs but in a production environment, these can be separate Duo tenants, or separate providers such as Entra ID, PingFederate, AD FS, ForgeRock, Shibboleth, etc.</p> <p>In the next section, you will configure local Webex authentication for a group of users and set up appropriate routing rules so that users are authenticated locally with Webex rather than routed to an external IdP.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Return to Control Hub and navigate to the Groups page in the Management section of the side panel.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the Webex groups section, click the Create a group button:</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Enter WxLocalAuth as the group name and click Next.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select Add manually, then search for chall and tbard and select both users to add them to the group.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Click Save then Done.</p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Authentication &gt; Identity Provider &gt; Add an IdP</p> </li> <li> <p>Select Webex, then click Next.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Take a minute to read the disclaimer providing more information about utilizing local Webex authentication.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tick the box for I've read and understood how Webex IdP works.

Any time a user logs in to an account in this organization,     Webex will check their uid (email address) against these rules.     These rules are checked in order of priority and the user will     be routed based on the first rule they match.</p> <p>b.  Due to this logic, rules should be placed in a most specific     &gt; least specific order.</p> <p>c.  Domain rules require that the domain(s) be verified or claimed,     or you will not be able to add them to the rule.</p> <p>d.  Domain rules can consist of multiple domains.</p> <p>e.  Group rules can specify either locally created Webex groups or     synchronized groups.</p> <p>f.  Groups rules can consist of multiple groups.</p> <p>g.  In this scenario, the two users that you added to the     WxLocalAuth group (chall and tbard) will match Rule #1     and they will route to the Webex Identity Broker for     authentication. No other users will match that rule, so they     would then be checked against Rule #2. If they don't match that     rule, they would match the Default Rule, so they would be     redirected to Duo for authentication via the SAML application.</p> <p>h.  The default rule does not have a filter so it will match all     users. It is likely that some users will match multiple rules     (for example, they may match two different group rules or a     group and domain rule). Remember, however, that Webex checks the     user against rules in order and the user will be routed as     soon as they match a rule -- they will not be checked against     lower priority rules.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open a new incognito or private window in your browser and navigate to https://web.webex.com. Click Sign in and enter tbard@cbXXX.dc-YY.com. and click next. You should be routed to Webex rather than Duo for authentication. This means that your rule is working as expected -- no need to log in.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Next, close your private/incognito window to clear any cached information, then open a new private/incognito window.</p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to https://web.webex.com and enter aperez@cbXXX.dc-YY.com (ensuring that you update the XXX and YY with your session #s).</p> <p>a.  This user's group membership will be checked to see if she     matches the criteria for the WxLocalAuthRule. Since Anita     Perez is not in the WxLocalAuth group, she will not match     the rule.</p> <p>b.  Next, her group membership will be checked against     GroupRule. She is in the selected group, so you should be     routed to Duo_OIDC for authentication.</p> <p>c.  In a few steps, you will check the Authentication log in Duo to     verify that users are being routed to the SAML and OIDC     integrations as expected so be sure to complete a successful     login with aperez@cbXXX.dc-YY.com.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, close your private/incognito window to clear any cached information, then open a new private/incognito window.</p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to https://web.webex.com and log in with jdock@cbXXX.dc-YY.com.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now that you've successfully authenticated to both the OIDC application (aperez) and SAML application (jdock), open the Duo admin portal (https://admin-demodemo.duosecurity.com).</p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to Reports &gt; Authentication Log.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Verify that jdock and aperez authenticated to the correct applications:</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> <p>It is very common to attempt this test in a browser that has a cached login for a different user (such as jdock or aperez). If you receive an error during testing, try using a new browser or try to close ALL private/incognito windows to ensure you're using a fresh session with no cached logins.</p> <p>You now have a working multiple IdP configuration.

Please see a proctor to get an audio file for testing with a shared org in Step 2 below.</p> <p>There are many factors involved in successfully decoding a recorded watermark. These include distance between the recording device and the speaker outputting the audio, audio volume, environmental noise, etc.</p> <p>Webex watermarking has additional resiliency to being encoded multiple times as might happen when the media is shared. The goal of the feature is to enable a successful decode of the watermark identifier in a broad but reasonable set of circumstances. The goal is that a recording device, such as a mobile phone, laying on a desk near a personal endpoint or laptop client will create a recording that yields a successful analysis. As the recording device is moved away from the source or obscured from hearing the full audio spectrum it will degrade the chances of a successful analysis. In summary, the recording device needs a reasonable capture of the meeting audio. If a user captures the audio on the computer that is hosting the client, then no limitations should apply.</p> <p>Once about 90 seconds have elapsed, end the meeting and the stop the recording.</p> <p>Step 2: Watermark Analysis:</p> <p>Next, you will analyze if the watermarks are present in the recording.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Please reach out to one of the proctors for an audio file for analysis.</p> </li> <li> <p>If not already logged in, log in to WKST1 and open an incognito instance of Chrome.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you haven\\'t received the file, please do not proceed to step 4.</p> <p>Navigate to admin.webex.com and login with cholland@cb460.dc-01.com and password as dCloud8088! - (please note this is a shared instance that will be used by other attendees, kindly do not make any changes).</p> <p>In Control Hub, navigate to Troubleshooting listed in the sidebar.</p> <p>Select the Watermark Analysis tab and select Analyze File.</p> <p>The Analyze audio watermark popup allows you to provide a name e.g., Pod1watermark for the analysis and some additional notes to help associate this request to any internal investigation case or point of contact.

As with zero trust E2EE meetings, calling data can only be accessed by authorized parties. The calling media encryption key is derived by the calling party and propagated to the called party via MLS key package. As such, encrypted call media cannot be decrypted by Webex cloud services, because Webex DOES NOT have access to the media encryption key - Zero Trust.</p> <p>Unlike the zero trust E2EE meetings, zero trust E2EE calling will downgrade to standard encryption (where Webex services have access to the media encryption key) if one of the called party's devices does not support zero trust E2EE (non-SIP, PSTN calls). Downgrades from zero trust E2EE to standard encryption will also occur when Webex services are enabled that require access to the media encryption keys - for example, when the call is recorded or when closed captioning is enabled on the call. In the same way that a call can downgrade to standard encryption, calls can also upgrade to zero trust E2EE in real-time after Webex services are removed.</p> <p>To begin, you will need to enable the zero trust end-to-end encryption feature.

Once logged in, navigate to Users and select Anita Perez.</p> <p></p> <p>e. Scroll down and click Administrator roles.</p> <p>f. Promote Anita Perez to Compliance Officer for the organization by ticking the box next to 'Compliance officer'. Click Save.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Review retention settings for Webex Messaging, Meetings, and Calling.</p> <p>One of the first compliance considerations is data retention. How long should data be retained before it is deleted? It's important for the compliance officer to understand the retention policies of the organization and to configure Webex to match these policies.</p> <p>Before proceeding, move to WKST2 (wkst2.dcloud.cisco.com). If not already connected, connect to WKST2. Login will be as Anita Prerez (dcloud\\aperez // dCloud123!).</p> <p>a. Open the Chrome browser on WKST2 (wkst1.dcloud.cisco.com) and navigate to Control Hub at https://admin.webex.com.</p> <p>b. Login to Control Hub as the compliance officer, Anita Perez by entering: aperez@cbXXX.dc-YY.com  Click Sign In.</p> <p>c. Enter password: dCloud123! (non-SSO password is dCloudZZZZ! - refer to eXpo dCloud session info page for the session ID and use the last 4 digits to replace 'ZZZZ').</p> <p>d. Once logged in, navigate to Organization Settings. In the search window at the top of the page, enter 'Retention' to locate the retention settings. Notice there are separate retention policies for Webex Messaging (messages, files), Webex Meetings (recordings, transcripts, chats, Q&amp;A, whiteboards, polls, etc.), and Webex Calling (recordings).</p> <p></p> <p>e. Click Settings under Webex App Messaging Retention Policy to review current messaging retention settings.</p> <p></p> <p>By default, the retention period is set to 360 days. Notice that separate retention periods can be set for 1:1 chat and group chat.</p> <p>For the purposes of this lab, there is no reason to change the message retention policy, so click Cancel to close the Webex Space retention policy window.</p> <p>f. Click Settings under Webex Meetings Retention Policy to review current meeting retention settings.</p> <p></p> <p>By default, the retention period is set to 360 days. Note that recording retention can be set to purge in 30 days, but by default the recordings follow the meetings retention policy. For the purposes of this lab, there is no reason to change the meeting retention policy, so just click Cancel to close the Webex Meetings Retention Policy window.</p> <p>g. Click Settings under Webex Calling Retention Policy to review current calling retention settings.</p> <p></p> <p>By default, the retention period for call recordings is set to 360 days. Notice that deleted recordings can be set to match the recording rentention period, but by default deleted recordings are set to purge immediately. Note that call details records (CDRs) retention is non-configurable. Again, for the purposes of this lab, there is no reason to change the calling retention policy, so just click Cancel to close the Webex Calling Retention Policy window.</p> <p>Note: Keep in mind that retention policies in Control Hub apply to data retention for data archived or stored on the Webex platform. When relying on a 3rd party archival system (e.g., Theta Lake), the retention setting of that platform will determine how long organization data is retained. Always ensure that the retention period configured in Control Hub and/or the 3rd party platform matches your organization's retention policy for data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review Webex Meeting controls and restrictions.</p> <p>On Control Hub navigate to Meeting, click Settings, and review the data and communication restriction controls available for meetings.</p> <p>The internal and external meeting configuration options allow you to control which external users can join your organization's meetings (Internal Webex meetings) and which external organization's meetings (External Webex meeting sites) your users can join. This type of restriction control allows an organization to mitigate potential data loss by disallowing certain attendees and/or meeting sites and may sufficiently address organizational requirements regarding data loss.</p> <p></p> <p>By default, external users are allowed to attend your organization's meetings, and your users can attend external meeting sites. For the purposes of this lab, you can leave the default values (e.g., no restrictions).</p> <p>In addition to controlling which users can join meetings and which meetings users are allowed to join, you can also restrict specific meeting features for both internal and external meetings.</p> <p>Scroll down and review the various meeting capabilities that can be disabled for internal or external meetings. For example, you could disable in-meeting tools like polling, Q&amp;A, chat, and recording. This type of meeting data restriction control allows an organization to mitigate and reduce potential data loss by disallowing certain channels of communication (e.g., Q&amp;A, chat, polling, etc.).</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>For the purposes of this lab, please leave the default values (e.g., no restrictions).</p> </li> <li> <p>Review Webex Calling controls and restrictions</p> <p>On Control Hub navigate to Calling, click Settings, then select Webex App, and scroll down to 'In-call feature access'. Review the available in-call features that can be disabled.</p> <p>An administrator can eliminate potential data leakage vectors to disable. For example, an adminstrator could prevent users from sharing content during a call (toggle off Screen Sharing) or sharing video on the call (toggle off Video on desktop/Video on mobile). Likewise, the administrator can prevent escalation of a call to a meeting (toggle off Move call to meetings on desktop app). These restrictions may sufficiently address organizational requirements regarding callingdata loss.</p> <p></p> <p>Note that by default, there are no restrictions for in-call features. For the purposes of this lab, please leave the default values (e.g., no restrictions).</p> </li> </ol> <p>Now that you've enabled the Compliance Officer role for user Anita Perez and reviewed Webex's built-in data retention and restrictions capabilities, it's time to move on and explore Webex integration to an external compliance platform.</p>"},{"location":"module3_compliance/#explore-ediscovery-for-webex-meetings-in-theta-lake","title":"Explore eDiscovery for Webex Meetings in Theta Lake","text":"<p>eDiscovery is the mechanism for searching through and retrieving data from the retained user-generated data archive of an organization. This ensures that the compliance officer has full access to all retained user data as needed for compliance management and enforcement. Because eDiscovery enables search and retrieval of data, this is often discussed together with Archiving capabilities which pertains with how and where the data that is being searched is stored.</p> <p>Webex has built-in eDiscovery/Legal Hold and archiving or data storage capabilities which may be sufficient for some organizations. The built-in Webex eDiscovery Search and Extraction portal provides Webex organizations the ability to access Webex stored and retained user-generated data. And as discussed earlier, there are retention settings in Control Hub which determine how long user-generated data is stored on the Webex platform. Note that exploring the Webex eDiscovery Search and Extraction portal is not part of this lab. However, for your reference, the Appendix of this lab guide has a module that covers the built-in Webex eDiscovery tool.

However, as discussed in Module 2, zero trust E2EE calls do not support call recording (or other features like closed captioning). So if a call has a corresponding audio recording, then it was not a zero trust E2EE call. On the oher hand, for any unrecorded call it would be impossible to tell the difference between a standard encrypted call and a zero trust E2EE call.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review CDR data record details</p> <p>Begin to review data records for Webex Calling. Start with an internal call.</p> <p>Scroll down and locate the set of call records: 750526890, 750526883. These should be listed sequentially and correspond to the terminating and originating legs of an internal call.</p> <p>To review a record, click the record. Select the Attributes record to see the call detail information.</p> <p></p> <p>First, note the CallType for each record is SIP_ENTERPRISE indicating this is an internal call.</p> <p>Next, look at the CorrelationId attribute and notice that it is the same for both records (3d8bafcd-519b-4ec9-86cd-c68aa4565870). This indicates that these two records are part of the same call. Later you will see that the call recording data record has the same CorrelationId.</p> <p>Notice one of the records (750526883) is the originating leg: CallDirection=ORIGINATING. And the other record (750526890)is the terminating leg: CallDirection=TERMINATING.</p> <p>Additional detailed call information is displayed including call duration (CallDurationSeconds), times (CallAnswerTime, CallStartTime), numbers (CalledNumber, CallingNumber), and caller ID (CalledLineId, CallingLineId).</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Review a call recording record</p> <p>Now let's look at record 750527005. This should be listed sequentially above the terminating and originating CDRs reviewed above. This record includes an audio recording of the call.</p> <p></p> <p>First, review the Attributes of the record. Observe that the CorrleationId (3d8bafcd-519b-4ec9-86cd-c68aa4565870) matches the two CDRs we reviewed above indicating this is the corresponding recording of that call. Also notice that the CallDirection parameter is 'ORIGINATING' indicating the call recording was started on the originator's leg of the call  </p> <p>Next, select Content Review to display the analysis of the recording made by the Theta Lake platform AI Compliance Advisor. This automated analysis indicates locations during the call recording where potential violations of compliance policy occurred. For example, the Compliance Advisor flagged multiple cases where 'cryptopcurrency' is mentioned during the call which is a violation of the built-in 'CryptoCurrency Discussions' policy. Likewise, the Compliance Advisor flagged instances of social security numbers, credit card numbers, material nonpublic information (insider trading), and sensitive documents being discussed on the call. This analysis is a great starting place for the Compliance Officer when reviewing data records on the Theta Lake platform.</p> <p> </p> <p>Review the details of this analysis noting the policies that were violated. Using the timestamps in the Content Review analysis see if you can locate one of the potential violations in the audio recording.</p> <p>Next, review the transcript of the recording. Select Transcript to display the transcript of the audio reocrding generated by the Theta Lake platform AI Compliance Advisor. This transcript along with the automated analysis by the AI Compliance Advisor keeps the Compliance Officer from having to review the audio recording saving a lot of time.</p> <p> </p> <p>Finally, try translating the transcript into another language. Click Translate, select the language to translate to from the dropdown (e.g., Dutch) and then, click Translate again. Notice the transcipt has been translated into the language selected. This can be very useful if the call audio is in a language that the Compliance Officer is unable to understand.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Review other Webex Calling data records</p> <p>Take a few minutes to review some other records to see other types of calls and other possible compliance policy violations.</p> <p>For example, look at the records for a PSTN call with a single CDR data record and the corresponding audio recording data record. Scroll down and locate data recordings: 73125943 and 73125955 which are the respective CDR and audio recording for a PSTN call. (Hint: To find these records faster, use the side panel to select a 'Create Date' filter with a custom data range of January 19, 2026 12:00AM - January 19, 2026 11:00PM. This filter will return just these two data records).</p> <p>Note that under Attributes for both of these records, the CorrelationId (060b2e06-b871-435e-8a60-33c6be7862db) is the same indicating they are from the same call. The CallType attribute of the CDR is SIP_NATIONAL which indicates this is a PSTN call. This is an outbound call (CallDirection = ORGINATING) to the PSTN and as mentioned previously, this is the only call leg CDR available since the system has no visibility to the PSTN side of the call. </p> <p>(Note: If this were an inbound PSTN call, then the CallType would be SIP_INBOUND and the CallDirection would be TERMINATING)</p> <p>Feel free to review the Content Review and Transcript details for the audio recording data record.</p> <p>Once you are done exploring other Webex Calling data records, before you proceed, ensure that you have cleared any filters and logged out of Theta Lake. </p> <p>This concludes Theta Lake compliance sections.</p> </li> </ol> <p>*** END of MODULE 3 **</p> <p>Continue with either Module 1 or Module 2:</p> <ul> <li>Module 1: Webex Identity</li> <li>Module 2: Zero Trust Encryption</li> <li>Module 3: Webex Compliance (current)</li> <li>Conclusion</li> </ul>"},{"location":"topology/","title":"Lab Topology","text":""},{"location":"topology/#lab-topology","title":"Lab Topology","text":""},{"location":"howToUse/Collaborative_Workflow_Windows/","title":"Collaborative Editing Workflow (Windows) - LTRCOL-2004 Lab Guide","text":""},{"location":"howToUse/Collaborative_Workflow_Windows/#collaborative-editing-workflow-windows-ltrcol-2004-lab-guide","title":"Collaborative Editing Workflow (Windows) - LTRCOL-2004 Lab Guide","text":""},{"location":"howToUse/Collaborative_Workflow_Windows/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<ul> <li>Git for Windows installed (https://git-scm.com/download/win)</li> <li>VSCode or Cursor installed</li> <li>Python 3.x installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)</li> <li>Access to the GitHub repository</li> </ul> <p>About the commands in this guide: - <code>REM</code> = Comment (doesn't execute, just explains the command) - You can skip typing <code>REM</code> lines - they're just explanations - Example: <code>REM Check status</code> \u2190 just explanation, <code>git status</code> \u2190 actual command</p>"},{"location":"howToUse/Collaborative_Workflow_Windows/#part-1-initial-setup","title":"Part 1: Initial Setup","text":"<p>Note: You can run all commands in this guide using either: - Cursor's integrated terminal (press <code>Ctrl + ~</code> to open) - Separate Command Prompt window - Cursor's Source Control panel (branch icon in left sidebar for visual Git operations)</p> <p>Recommended: Use Cursor's integrated terminal for convenience!</p> <p>Where to find Cursor's terminal: 1.
