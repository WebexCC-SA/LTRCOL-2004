## Generating User Data for Compliance in Meetings

**Step 1:**

1. In this section, you will learn how to configure Compliance and Supervision for Webex Meetings. Theta Lake provides AI-based archiving, eDiscovery, and supervision for Webex Meetings with automated detection of compliance risks in audio and visual content. Open a remote desktop session to WKST1, navigate to https://admin.webex.com and click **Sign in.** Enter the credentials for cholland, <cholland@cbXXX.dc-YY.com> and password **dCloud123!** (if you didn't complete module 1, refer to last 4 digits of the Session ID on eXpo dCloud Session View page for the non-SSO password).

1. Go to Services \> Meeting and copy the site name.

      ![](./media/image242.png)

1. Open an instance of Chrome browser and navigate to the sitename e.g., cb46001.webex.com and log in with credentials for cholland, <cholland@cbXXX.dc-YY.com> and password **dCloud123!** (if you didn't complete module 1, refer to last 4-digits of Session ID on eXpo dCloud Session View page for the non-SSO password).

1. Click **Schedule** and then **Schedule a meeting**

      ![](./media/image243.png)

1. Set your meeting type as **Webex Meetings Pro Meeting** and set a meeting topic. Invite Anita Perez and Kellie Melby.

      ![](./media/image244.png)

      Click **Schedule** (or **Start**).

1. On WKST1, start the meeting from the Webex App. Click **OK** to the **Microphone Not Available** prompt and click on Start Meeting.

      ![](./media/image245.png)

1. Click OK on the subsequent microphone warning once the meeting is launched.

      ![](./media/image246.png)

1. Log in to **WKST2** and **WKST3** with Anita (aperez@cbXXX.dc-YY.com) and Kellie (kmelby@cbXXX.dc-YY.com) respectively and launch the Webex App. Click the green Join button to join the meeting.

      ![](./media/image247.png)

1. On WKST1, click **Record the meeting** and save to the cloud option. Once Charles, Anita, and Kellie are in the meeting, open the in-meeting chat from any of the workstations and populate the chat with fake confidential or PII like date of birth, SSNs, credit card numbers, or keywords like Top Secret or Confidential.

      ![](./media/image248.png)

      Example:

      ![](./media/image249.png)

1. On **WKST1**, click the bottom-right ellipsis next to the chat button, then select **Slido (polling and Q&A)** and click **Open** to launch Slido.

      ![](./media/image250.png)

1. Click **Open**

      ![](./media/image251.png)

1. Click on **Create Slido**, click on **Add** and select **Audience Q&A**

      ![](./media/image252.png)

      ![](./media/image253.png)

1. Navigate to WKST2 (Anita) and WKST3 (Kellie), launch Slido (if it's not already launched) and ask questions that contain sensitive data.e.g. from Anita's WKST2, you can this question "Charles, I am sharing my Credit Card Details here. It is 5678-0987-1234-0987 - is this what you wanted?"

      ![](./media/image254.png)

1. From Kellie's WKST3 ask the following question as e.g. "Here is my data, Charles. Date of Birth == 12th Jan 1984 SSN == 123-25-6078, is this fine?"

      ![](./media/image255.png)

1. Now that we have provided Input on Q&A, lets launch a poll and share sensitive data.

1. Navigate to WKST1 and click on home in the Slido panel and then Add and Select Survey. Slido offers multiple poll options like Word Cloud, Multiple Choice, Quizzes, Ranking, Ratings and Surveys along with Open Text. For the lab select **Survey**. Then, select any option, and populate it with sensitive data.

      ![](./media/image256.png)

1. Add a couple of questions to the survey and click **Launch** to start the survey.

      ![](./media/image257.png)

1. Go to WKST2 and WKST3 and provide fake sensitive data for the questions asked like "Mothers Maiden Name" and "Credit Card Numbers". Once you have provided the inputs, from WKST1, click on Deactivate Survey and close the Slido App Panel.

      ![](./media/image258.png)

1. The poll has confidential and sensitive information like a mother's maiden name, and credit card number. This simulates end users sharing confidential or proprietary information and demonstrates how compliance platforms like Theta Lake effectively identify and act on the offense. End the meeting from WKST1 by clicking on Red "X" and Select "End Meeting for all".

## Provision users and enable recording for Webex Calling for data compliance.
In this section, we shall setup the users with Webex calling, enable the native recording capability now available with Webex.

1. RDP to WKST1, navigate to admin.webex.com and click on Sign in with credentials for cholland, <cholland@cbXXX.dc-YY.com> and password dCloud123! (if you didn't complete module 1, refer to last 4-digits of Session ID on eXpo dCloud Session View page for the non-SSO password).

1. Navigate to Services > Calling > Service Settings

      ![](./media/image259.png)

1. Scroll to call recording and select Provider as Webex, Storage region as United States along with Call recording failure settings to Proceed with the call with announcement, select the compliance announcements to Play Announcements for inbound as well as outbound PSTN calls.

      ![](./media/image260.png)

      Click **Save** to save these settings.

1. Now let's allocate Webex calling Professional licenses for two users Ricardo Filice and Eric Steele.

1. Navigate to Management tab on the left and the Users option. Search for
Eric Steele and under the Summary tab, navigate to Licenses and select
Edit Licenses.

      ![](./media/image261.png)

1. Select Edit Licenses on the next screen, go to calling and uncheck Call on Webex (1:1 call, non-PSTN) to Webex Calling option at the bottom and select Webex Calling Professional. For the purposes of this lab, you don't need to select Attendant Console and click Save.

      ![](./media/image262.png)

1. Let's assign a calling number to Eric, in the Location Drop-down select DCloud, Phone Number leave as is and in extension provide an extension number to Eric e.g. in the screenshot, I have provided 5001 and hit Save.

      ![](./media/image263.png)

1. Perform the same steps for Ricardo Filice (rfilice) and assign him
extension 5002.

For this lab, we are not setting up PSTN either via Local GW or Cisco
Calling plans, the aim of this module is to showcase the built-in call
recording capability now available for our calling platform in addition
to meetings.

Next, you'll use the login credentials of the **read-only compliance
officer account** to see sample data that we have compiled in a Theta
Lake tenant over the last year, including data that matches the test
meeting you just scheduled and attended.

In the subsequent two modules we shall cover with examples how Theta
Lake can flag compliance issues in Meetings, Calling, Slido Polling and
Q&A.

## Explore Compliance Options for Webex Meetings in Theta Lake

We want you to spend some time reviewing some of the compliance options for Webex meetings available via Theta Lake.

Theta Lake can process data from in-meeting chat, polls, Q&A, shared
files, and other meeting content (like the data you just generated).
Theta Lake can also detect content from users' audio/video streams such
as, files shared visually or verbally during the meeting (e.g., an
attendee holding a paper with sensitive information written on it or
verbally mentioning credit card numbers/SSN/DOB). You will learn how Theta Lake can help us flag these violations as well.

**Step 1:**

1. Navigate to <https://useast.thetalake.ai/#/users/login> on WKST1. Log in with read-only Compliance Officer credentials (**co.read.only@gmail.com** // **dCloud123!)**. You will find pre-populated data that demonstrates some of the violations and types of data that Theta Lake can process. Once logged in click the **Search** tab, enter the search term **Poll**, and click the green **Search** button. Note: the screenshot below is using the **Table** viewing format. This can be found on the right side of the screen near the **Sort by** option.
